# SwarmAI-Lab documentation

Welcome to the SwarmAI-Lab reference site. This project packages a small, readable set of primitives for running and visualizing consensus-style simulations. Use the navigation to explore the API and see how to configure reproducible experiments.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies (Python 3.10+):

   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Export the source tree so imports resolve from the repository root:

   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)/src"
   ```

3. Run tests to confirm the environment is healthy:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

For more context, read the [README](../README.md) in the repository root.
