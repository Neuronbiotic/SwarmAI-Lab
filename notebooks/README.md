# Notebooks

Use this directory to prototype new update rules or visualize results. Activate your virtual environment and register a kernel:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/setup_kernel.sh swarmlab
```

Then open your favorite notebook UI (JupyterLab, VS Code, etc.) and select the `swarmlab` kernel to run examples.
